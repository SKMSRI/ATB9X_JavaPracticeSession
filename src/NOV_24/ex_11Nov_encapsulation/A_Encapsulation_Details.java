//Encapsulation is a core principle of object-oriented programming in Java that involves
// bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a
// single unit, typically a class.
//Private fields (name, age, salary) do not allow direct access.
//Public methods (getName(), setName(), etc.) allow controlled access.
//Additional validations can be added inside the setter methods to enforce business
// rules (e.g., checking if age or salary is valid).
